#### a simple yet meaningful BMI Calculator app built with Flutter.

### What is BMI?

BMI stands for Body Mass Index — it's a quick way to assess if a person’s weight is in a healthy range for their height.

The app calculates BMI, determines the health category (Underweight / Normal / Overweight / Obese), and gives simple tips based on the result.
